# NU_16S_Classifier
LSTM &amp; CRG Taxonomic classifier
Taxanomic assignment is the process of determining the microbial composition  of a sample using Homolgy (alignment) or Machine Learning.

Here we try to do Machine learning taxonomic assignment using LSTM model OR CNN using CGR.

The database we use for modeling is SILVA 16S RNA.
Here a small sample of it for testing.

For full training you can download the whole data from here:
