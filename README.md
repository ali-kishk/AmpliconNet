### SpeciesMLP: 
### Sequence based Multi-layer Perceptron For Amplicon Read Classification Using Real-time Data Augmentation

Taxanomic assignment is the process of determining the microbial composition  of a sample using Homolgy (alignment) or Machine Learning.

In order to reduce modeling time of the direct sequences, In-silico PCR was applied on SILVA database. Total number of 14 subset databases were generated by universal primers for each single or paired high variable region (HVR). Moreover, in this study, we illustrate the results for the V2 database model on 8443 classes on the species level and 1552 on the genus level. In order to simulate sequencing fragmentation, we trained variable length subsequences from 50 bases till the full length of the HVR that are randomly changing in each training iteration. Simple MLP model with global max pooling gives 0.71 & 0.93 test accuracy for the species and genus levels respectively (for reads of 100 base sub-sequences) and 0.75 & 0.96 accuracy for the species and genus levels respectively (on the full length V2 HVR). In this study, we present a novel method to model the direct amplicon sequence using MLP over a sequence of k-mers faster 20 times than CNN in training and 10 times in prediction.


The database we use for modeling is SILVA 16S RNA.
Here a small sample of it for testing SILVA_132_dump.fasta .
